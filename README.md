### Evaluation framework

#### Inference modes

| **Mode**                                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Textual Chain-of-Thought (TCoT)** | TCoT is a reasoning mode in which LLMs solve data analysis problems step by step through pure textual reasoning. The final answer is output exclusively in text form.                      |
| **Program-of-Thought (PoT)**          | PoT is a reasoning mode in which LLMs solve data analysis problems by generating executable code. In this mode, the model combines textual reasoning with programmatic outputs and ultimately producing a code block as its final answer.                                                            |
| **Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (ICoT)**           | The ICoT mode enables models to perform multi-step reasoning by combining textual explanations and programmatic outputs in an iterative process. This advanced mode integrates planning, step-by-step execution, and self-reflection, allowing the model to dynamically adapt its reasoning based on intermediate results.                                                                      |


#### Evaluation metrics

| **Metric**                                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Natural Language Metrics** | Natural language metrics including BLEU and ROUGE-L.                      |
| **LLM-as-a-Judge**          | A discriminant LLM is used to assess semantic similarity and correctness of answers against ground truth                                                            |
| **Exact Match Accuracy**           | Accuracy is utilized for tasks where LLMs are required to generate outputs in a predefined format, enabling direct and unambiguous comparison with ground truth.   

## 🔧 How to evaluate LLMs on TReB

### Step 1. Download the dataset

Download the latest version of <a href="https://modelscope.cn/datasets/JiuTian-AI/JIUTIAN-TReB">🤗 Dataset</a> from Hugging Face and place it in your working directory.

### Step 2. Write your config file

Write your JSON config file for evaluation.

Example JSON structure:
```json
{
    "version": "default", # Inference version, affects result path
    "round": 1, // Inference round
    "model_config": {
        "reason_model_name": "{your model name}", // Reasoning model name, e.g., QwQ-32B
        "reason_model_path": "{your model path}", // Path to reasoning model
        "reason_model_cards": "0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7", // GPUs for reasoning model
        "reason_max_model_len": 8192, // Context length for reasoning model
        "reason_temperature": 0.2, // Temperature for reasoning model
        "judge_model_name": "{your judge model name}", // Judge model name
        "judge_model_path": "{your judge model path}", // Path to judge model
        "judge_model_cards": "0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7", // GPUs for judge model
        "judge_max_model_len": 10240 // Context length for judge model
    },
    "dataset_config": {
        "Table_Retrieval": { // Dataset name
            "path": "{your data path}/Table_Retrieval.json", // Dataset path
            "reason_mode": [ // Inference modes (multiple options)
                "TCoT_md", // TCoT mode, Tables in markdown format
                "TCoT_html", // TCoT mode, Tables in HTML format
                "PoT", // PoT mode
                "ICoT" // ICoT mode
            ],
            "if_instruction": false, // Include instructions in prompt
            "if_title": true, // Include table title in prompt
            "metrics": [ // Evaluation metrics (multiple options)
                "BLEU", // BLEU score
                "ROUGE", // ROUGE-L score
                "EM", // Exact Match
                "LLM_score" // LLM-as-a-judge score
            ]
        },
        ...
    }
}
```
We provide an example config file at: `config/config_example.json`

### Step 3. Run evaluation with Your LLM
The following two steps need to be run to get the evaluation results:
1. **Execute model inference**:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python -u run_eval.py --config "your-config-file.json" --run_step "reason"
   ```

2. **Execute answer evaluation**:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python -u run_eval.py --config "your-config-file.json" --run_step "judge"
   ```

### Step 4. Check the Results
All results are saved in the jsonl file at the following path: 
```
eval_output/{config_json['version']}/{config_json['model_config']['reason_model_name']}/{inference mode}--{dataset name}--round{config_json['round']}--judge.jsonl
```
For example, if your config file is the same as the contents of Step2, the evaluation results of the dataset `Table_Retrieval` in `PoT` mode are saved in the following path:
```
eval_output/default/{your model name}/PoT--Table_Retrieval--round1--judge.jsonl
```
Read the jsonl file by rows, each row being a json that stores all the information for a single sample. the scores field is `judge_scores`.

Example JSON structure:

```json
{
  // The following fields correspond to the fields in the dataset.
  "id": "dataset_name|example_id",
  "file_path": ["path/example.csv"],
  "instruction": "example_instruction",
  "question":"example_question",
  "answer":"example_answer",
  "title":["example_title"],
  "columnslable": [1],
  "Table_markdown":["example_markdown"],
  "Table_html":["example_html"],
  "number_answer": "str or float",

  // The following are fields related to model inference.
  "mode":"PoT", // infer mode
  "df":"dataframe str",
  "input_prompt":"example prompt", // question prompt
  "history":"example history", // full history
  "generation":"example generation", // model response
  "text_result":"text answer", // parsed TCoT or ICoT answer
  "code":"the last code", // parsed last code
  "code_run_result":"code run result", // parsed PoT answer

  // The following are fields related to evaluation scores.
  "judge_scores":
    {
      "BLEU": 0.0, // BLEU score
      "ROUGE": 0.0, // ROUGE-L score (range is [0, 1])
      "EM": 0.0, // exact match score
      "LLM_score": 0, // LLM-as-a-judge score (range is [0, 10])
      "LLM_score_reason": "\\boxed{0}" // LLM-as-a-judge reponse
    },
}
```

## Note
Some details to note:
- The Python package versions mentioned in `requirements.txt` are not strictly fixed. Users can modify these versions appropriately based on their own environment.
- When testing `Natural Language Understanding` tasks, the output may display `{data_id}: no table content!`. This is a normal output since the tasks do not involve input tables.
- During the `judge` phase, the output may include `INFO rouge_scorer.py:83: Using default tokenizer`. This is also a normal output.
- For security reasons, we only allow the program to access files in specific directories (including config, eval_log, and eval_output). If needed, you can modify the `is_safe_path` function in `file_op.py`.
- The code executor in this project has only undergone basic security rule configuration, which cannot prevent the generation of unsafe code by the model. Therefore, this project is not recommended for direct use in production environments. Disclaimer: This project is intended for academic research purposes only. Any security issues caused by improper use are not the responsibility of this project.
